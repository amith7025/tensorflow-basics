# TensorFlow Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression neural network implemented using TensorFlow. The neural network is trained to perform linear regression on a given dataset.


## Introduction

This project serves as a basic example of implementing a linear regression neural network using TensorFlow. The neural network is trained to predict output values based on input features in a linear fashion.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
